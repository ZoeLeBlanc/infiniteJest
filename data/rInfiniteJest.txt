I have two data files.  1. chapter position information. 2. character posisition character. I need to put them together. 

Read in the files


```r
chapPos <- read.table("chapterPosition.txt", header = TRUE)
charPos <- read.table("characterPosition.txt", header = TRUE)
```


Check those datasets out.


```r
head(chapPos)
head(charPos)
```
