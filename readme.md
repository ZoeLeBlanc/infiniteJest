#Infinite Jest

There are two overarching goals for the project 

1. Learn Python
2. Analyze and visualize text patterns in the book Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. 

This will be ongoing and most likely never be finished because the goals can never fully be accomplished, which is why I love this project.
